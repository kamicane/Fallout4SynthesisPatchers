# Immersive Pickup Sounds

[Immersive Pickup sounds](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/35917) as a Synthesis Patcher.
Needs Immersive Pickup Sounds sound descriptors available. You can use the esp included in the Data folder which contains only the sound descriptors and none of the worldspace edits. Still requires the main mod for the sound files.
You can add/remove forms and sounds by editing ImmersivePickupSounds.yml.

This patcher should be regenerated from scratch on every run, please use [CleanESL](../CleanESL) as the first item in your group, or manually delete the resulting ESP before re-running.

By design, this patcher does not generate any new forms, and is safe to remove at any time.
